    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <em>Last updated: 2025-11-30</em>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected when
      using the
      <strong>Foxtales</strong>
      application, how it is used, to whom it may be shared, and what rights you have regarding the
      processing of your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Data Controller</h2>
    <p>
      The data controller is:
      <br />
      <strong>Hubert Górski</strong>
      <br />
      Contact:
      <strong>office@foxtales.cc</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      The Controller processes data in accordance with applicable laws, including the GDPR.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
    <p>The application may collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>email address provided during registration,</li>
      <li>username,</li>
      <li>
        technical data automatically transmitted by your browser or device, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address,</li>
          <li>browser type and version,</li>
          <li>device and operating system information,</li>
          <li>server logs and traffic statistics (Cloudflare).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>The application does not collect sensitive data</strong>
      (e.g., health, political opinions).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Technical data originates from communication between your browser or device and the
      application, as well as from security and infrastructure services provided by Cloudflare.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      All personal data is obtained directly from the user or automatically by the device when using
      the application. The application does not obtain data from third parties.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>3. Purposes of Data Processing</h2>
    <p>Data is processed for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ensuring the proper functioning of the application and user accounts,</li>
      <li>maintenance and administration of accounts,</li>
      <li>ensuring security, detecting and preventing abuse,</li>
      <li>traffic analysis and technical statistics to improve the application,</li>
      <li>handling user requests and contact inquiries.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>Data is processed on the basis of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR — processing necessary for the performance of a contract or steps taken
        prior to entering into a contract (e.g., account maintenance),
      </li>
      <li>
        Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR — legitimate interest of the Controller (system security, traffic
        analysis, preventing abuse),
      </li>
      <li>Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR — user consent, if required by additional application features.</li>
      <li>
        Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR — where the Controller is required to store data under legal obligations
        (e.g., security or anti-abuse requirements).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Technical data such as IP address, server logs, and browser/device information is processed
      under the Controller’s legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) to ensure system security,
      detect abuse, and maintain the stability and proper functioning of the application.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Providing personal data is voluntary, but some data — such as email address and username — is
      necessary to create an account and use the application. Failure to provide it will prevent
      registration and access to full functionality.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>5. Data Sharing and Processors</h2>
    <p>
      Your data is not sold. It may be shared only with trusted entities processing data on behalf
      of the Controller (processors), such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloudflare</strong>
        — CDN services, protection, logs, and traffic statistics,
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>OVH</strong>
        — hosting providers,
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Zoho</strong>
        — email service providers and entities providing technical support necessary for the
        application to function.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      Data recipients may include service providers supporting the Controller, particularly IT
      service providers, hosting providers, email providers, system security companies, and other
      entities processing data under data processing agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the scope of protection against abuse and cyberattacks (e.g., DDoS), Cloudflare may act as
      an independent data controller in accordance with its own privacy policy and scope of security
      services.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>6. Data Transfers Outside the European Economic Area (EEA)</h2>
    <p>
      Services such as Cloudflare may process data on servers located outside the EEA. In such
      cases, appropriate safeguards are applied, such as
      <strong>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)</strong>
      approved by the European Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Data may also be processed in countries outside the EEA where Cloudflare maintains its
      infrastructure.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>7. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      The application uses only cookies necessary for proper functionality, particularly session
      cookies ensuring security and essential features. We do not use marketing or tracking cookies.
      Users may manage cookies through their browser settings.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>8. Data Retention Period</h2>
    <p>
      Data is stored for the period necessary to achieve the purposes for which it was collected:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        account data (email, username) — until the account is deleted + backups for up to 90 days,
      </li>
      <li>server logs and technical data — 90 days,</li>
      <li>
        data processed based on consent — until consent is withdrawn or the relevant feature is no
        longer used.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>right of access,</li>
      <li>right to rectification,</li>
      <li>right to erasure (“right to be forgotten”),</li>
      <li>right to restriction of processing,</li>
      <li>right to data portability,</li>
      <li>right to object to processing,</li>
      <li>
        right to withdraw consent at any time (this does not affect the lawfulness of processing
        before withdrawal).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The right to object applies in particular to data processed based on the Controller’s
      legitimate interest (Art. 21 GDPR).
    </p>
    <p>
      Consent may be withdrawn at any time by sending a message to
      <strong>office@foxtales.cc</strong>
      . A response will be provided within 30 days in accordance with the GDPR.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>10. Data Deletion Procedure</h2>
    <p>
      To delete your account or data, send a request to
      <strong>office@foxtales.cc</strong>
      indicating the email address associated with the account. Data will be deleted in accordance
      with applicable procedures unless legal regulations require further retention (e.g., for
      investigative purposes).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>11. No Profiling or Automated Decision-Making</h2>
    <p>
      The Controller does not use profiling or automated decision-making referred to in Art. 22 GDPR
      that would produce legal effects concerning the user or similarly significantly affect them.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>12. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We apply appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from
      unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure — such as encrypted transmission, server security,
      access control, and regular system updates.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>13. External Links</h2>
    <p>
      The application may contain links to third-party websites. The Controller is not responsible
      for the privacy practices of those websites. We recommend reviewing their data protection
      policies.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>14. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy. Users will be informed of
      significant changes through an update of the date in the document header.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>15. Complaint to the Supervisory Authority</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the GDPR, you have the right
      to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority:
      <br />
      <strong>President of the Personal Data Protection Office (UODO)</strong>
      <br />
      ul. Stawki 2, 00-193 Warsaw, Poland.
    </p>
    <p>You also have the right to pursue claims before a common court.</p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The application may be used by individuals of any age. If a user is under 13 years old, we
      recommend using the application with the knowledge and consent of a legal guardian.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h2>17. Data Protection Officer</h2>
    <p>
      The Controller has not appointed a Data Protection Officer, as they are not required to do so
      under Art. 37 GDPR. For matters related to data protection, you may contact:
