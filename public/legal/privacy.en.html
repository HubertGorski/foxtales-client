    <p>
      Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected when
      using the

      <strong>office @ foxtales.cc</strong>
      <br />
      <br />
      The Controller processes data in accordance with the applicable laws, including the GDPR.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
    <p>The application may collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>email address provided during registration,</li>
      <li>username,</li>
      <li>
        technical data automatically transmitted by your browser or device, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>IP address,</li>
          <li>browser type and version,</li>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>The application does not collect sensitive data</strong>
      (such as health, political, or biometric data).
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      Technical data comes from the communication between your browser or device and the
      application, as well as from security and infrastructure services provided by Cloudflare.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      All personal data is obtained directly from the user or automatically from the device when
      using the application. The application does not obtain data from third parties.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2>3. Purposes of Data Processing</h2>
    <p>Your data is processed for the purpose of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ensuring proper functioning of the application and user accounts,</li>
      <li>maintaining and managing accounts,</li>
      <li>ensuring security, detecting and preventing misuse,</li>
      <li>traffic analysis and technical statistics to improve the application,</li>
      <li>handling user inquiries and support requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
    <p>Data is processed on the basis of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Article 6(1)(b) GDPR — processing necessary for the performance of a contract or actions
        prior to entering into a contract (e.g., account maintenance),
      </li>
      <li>
        Article 6(1)(f) GDPR — legitimate interest of the Controller (ensuring system security,
        traffic analysis, preventing misuse),
      </li>
      <li>
        Article 6(1)(a) GDPR — user's consent, if required for additional application features,
      </li>
      <li>Article 6(1)(c) GDPR — compliance with legal obligations (e.g., system security).</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <p>
      Technical data such as IP address, server logs, and browser or device information is processed
      on the basis of the Controller’s legitimate interest (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR) to ensure
      security, detect misuse, and maintain the stability of the application.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      Providing personal data is voluntary, but some data — such as email address and username — is
      necessary to register and use the application. Without it, creating an account is not
      possible.
