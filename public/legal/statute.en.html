        <li>
          The operator of the Application is:
          <strong>Hubert Górski</strong>
          , providing the service as a natural person not engaged in business activity.

          of an electronic service agreement between the User and the Operator under the conditions
          specified herein.
        </li>

        <li>
          The Terms of Service are available in the Application and on the website. In case of
          discrepancies between versions published in different locations, the version available at
          <a href="https://foxtales.cc">foxtales.cc</a>
          shall prevail.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>2. Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service / Application</strong>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User</strong>
          – a person using the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Account</strong>
          – the User’s account in the Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>User Content</strong>
          – any materials published by Users (text, image, audio, multimedia, data).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Codes / Activation Codes</strong>
          – unique strings of characters entered in the Application to unlock features or virtual
          items.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Scope of Services and Free-of-Charge Use</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Service is entertainment- and community-oriented and is provided free of charge
          (free-to-use). The Operator does not charge fees for basic use of the Application.
        </li>
        <li>
          As of the date of publication of these Terms of Service, the Application does not offer
          paid features or an internal store. Should paid features be introduced, the Operator will
          inform Users separately and update the Terms and payment rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User does not need to enter into any paid service agreement to use the basic features
          of the Application.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>4. Conclusion and Termination of the Agreement</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The electronic service agreement between the User and the Operator is concluded upon
          registration of an account or upon starting to use the Service (if usage is possible
          without registration).
        </li>
        <li>
          The User may stop using the Service at any time. Account deletion (termination of the
          agreement by the User) is carried out by sending an email to
          <strong>office @ foxtales.cc</strong>
          or through an account deletion function, if available within the Application. The Operator
          will delete the Account and data in accordance with the Privacy Policy and applicable
          regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator may terminate the agreement (block or delete the Account) in case of
          violation of the Terms by the User. The User will be informed via email or other available
          contact methods, unless immediate blocking is justified (e.g., legal or security
          violations).
        </li>
        <li>
          The effective date of termination or change of permissions will be indicated in the notice
          sent to the User. In the case of material changes to the Terms, the Operator will inform
          Users at least 7 days before the changes take effect (vacatio legis), unless longer notice
          is required by law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>5. Registration and Account Security</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Registration requires providing a valid email address, username, and password. The User is
          obliged to provide truthful information.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User is responsible for keeping login data confidential and not sharing it with third
          parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User must immediately report suspected unauthorized access to the Account to
          <strong>office @ foxtales.cc</strong>
          .
        </li>
        <li>
          The User must not attempt to bypass Application security, perform brute-force attacks on
          codes, or attempt to compromise system integrity; such actions constitute violations of
          the Terms and the law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>6. User Content – License and Publication Conditions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>The User retains copyright to their User Content.</li>
        <li>
          By publishing User Content in the Application, the User grants the Operator a free,
          non-exclusive, irrevocable (for content already published) license to:
          <ul>
            <li>display, share, and store User Content as part of the Service,</li>
            <li>
              perform technical modifications necessary for displaying the content (e.g.,
              transcoding, resizing),
            </li>
            <li>
              create backups and store them in the Operator’s systems and systems of service
              processors,
            </li>
            <li>make content available to other Users within Application features.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The license granted by the User remains in effect for the time necessary to provide the
          Service and process data in accordance with the Privacy Policy; after User deletion of the
          content, the Operator will remove it from visible areas, but backup copies may be stored
          for the period described in the Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User represents that they have all rights to the materials they publish and that their
          publication does not infringe the rights of third parties. The User agrees to indemnify
          the Operator against claims resulting from copyright or personal rights violations.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>7. Prohibited Content and Restrictions</h2>
      <p>The following User Content is strictly prohibited:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>content that violates applicable law (including incitement to crime),</li>
        <li>content infringing copyrights, related rights, or personal rights of third parties,</li>
        <li>
          child sexual abuse material, content with a pedophilic nature, or content sexualizing
          persons under 18 (including fictional characters represented as minors),
        </li>
        <li>
          erotic or pornographic content published in violation of applicable laws or Application
          rules (if a given section is marked as 18+),
        </li>
        <li>deepfake pornography, materials violating intimacy or privacy of others,</li>
        <li>
          disclosure of personal data (doxxing), account numbers, passwords, or other sensitive
          information of third parties,
        </li>
        <li>
          hate speech, violence, threats, terrorist content, or materials promoting extremism,
        </li>
        <li>
          spam, unsolicited advertisements, or mass commercial messages without the Operator’s
          consent,
        </li>
        <li>
          materials obtained through illegal scraping, automated content harvesting, or sources
          violating copyrights,
        </li>
        <li>
          gore or other extremely shocking materials published in violation of law or good morals.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. 18+ Content and Obligations for Adult-Oriented Sections</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If any part of the Application contains content intended only for adults (18+), such
          sections will be clearly marked and accompanied by an adult content warning. The User must
          confirm they are an adult before accessing such sections.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator does not perform mandatory age verification in every case; responsibility for
          accessing 18+ content lies with the User and their guardians (in the case of minors). The
          Operator may, but is not obligated to, implement age verification mechanisms.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is strictly forbidden to publish any content sexualizing or depicting persons under 18.
          Upon detection, the Operator will act immediately (removal, reporting to authorities), if
          required by law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>9. Activation Codes and Prohibition of Security Bypass</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Application allows entering Activation Codes that unlock features or game elements.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator does not sell Codes within the Application; Codes may be distributed outside
          the Application (rewards, promotions, partners).
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator is not responsible for transactions involving Codes conducted outside the
          Application (sales, exchanges between users, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
          Any attempts to bypass security mechanisms related to Codes, including brute-force
          attacks, mass guessing, tampering with code validation mechanisms, or other unauthorized
          unlocking attempts, are prohibited. Such actions may result in Account blocking and
          reporting to relevant authorities.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>10. Moderation, Liability, and No Preventive Monitoring</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Operator does not continuously monitor all published content preventively. However,
          the Operator may at any time review, delete, or restrict access to content if a violation
          of the Terms or law is suspected.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator is not responsible for User Content published in the Application —
          responsibility lies with the User who publishes the content.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator reserves the right to respond to reports from users and authorities,
          including removing content and temporarily blocking access to it.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>11. Notice-and-Takedown Procedure and Counter-Notices</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Reports of copyright infringement or other significant violations may be sent to:
          <strong>office @ foxtales.cc</strong>
          . A report should include: information about the reporter, description of the work,
          location of the material in the Application, a good-faith statement, a truthfulness
          statement (as required by law), and contact details.
        </li>
        <li>
          After receiving a complete report, the Operator may take temporary measures (hiding,
          blocking, removing) until the matter is clarified.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User whose content has been removed may submit a counter-notice containing contact
          details, identification of the removed content, justification, and a truthfulness
          statement. The Operator will review the counter-notice and restore the content if
          justified.
        </li>
        <li>
          In cases of misuse of the reporting procedure (false statements), the Operator reserves
          the right to take action against the reporter, including disclosure of data at the request
          of law enforcement, in accordance with applicable regulations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator is not required to disclose User data to reporters; disclosure may occur only
          under a lawful request from authorities or in cases provided by law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>12. Cache, Backups, Logs</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Content and data transmitted within the Application may be stored in cache, backups, and
          system logs. Deleting content by the User does not mean immediate deletion of all copies
          (e.g., backups, cache, logs), which may be stored according to the periods specified in
          the Privacy Policy.
        </li>
        <li>
          Server logs and technical information (e.g., IP address, header data) may be stored in
          accordance with the Operator’s security obligations and legal requirements; retention
          periods and protections are described in the Privacy Policy.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>13. Security</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Operator applies technical and organizational measures adequate to the nature of the
          Service to protect data and the system (encrypted transmission, updates, server
          protection). However, the Operator does not guarantee absolute absence of risk — using the
          Service is at the User’s own risk.
        </li>
        <li>
          The User agrees not to upload malware, viruses, automated attack scripts, or any harmful
          data into the Application.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>14. Automation / AI-Generated Content</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the Application uses or provides features based on artificial intelligence (AI) to
          generate content, Users will be informed at the point of publication.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator is not responsible for automatically generated content if its use complies
          with the Terms; the User who approves or publishes the generated content is responsible
          for any violations of law.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Operator is not liable for indirect damages or lost profits resulting from the use of
          the Service, unless otherwise provided by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator does not guarantee uninterrupted availability of the Service or absence of
          errors; maintenance and updates may be performed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator is not responsible for actions of Users outside the Service (including
          trading Codes outside the Application).
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>16. Complaints and Support Requests</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Complaints regarding the operation of the Service should be sent to
          <strong>office @ foxtales.cc</strong>
          with a description of the issue and contact details.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Operator will make reasonable efforts to respond within 30 calendar days. In justified
          cases, the resolution time may be extended, and the User will be informed.
        </li>
        <li>
          In case of disputes, the User may file a complaint with the President of the Personal Data
          Protection Office (UODO) or pursue claims in court.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>17. Consumer Rights and Information About Free-of-Charge Use</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Service is provided free of charge. There are no fees for basic use of the Application
          (as of the date of the last update of these Terms).
        </li>
        <li>
          If paid features are introduced in the future, Users will be informed in advance, and the
          Terms will be updated as described in section 4.
        </li>
        <li>
          Information on consumer rights, including available protection measures, is available from
          relevant authorities and applicable regulations. In the case of purchasing digital
          products outside the Application (e.g., codes sold in an external store), refund terms and
          consumer rights are governed by consumer law and the retailer’s terms.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>18. Changes to the Terms of Service</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The Operator may amend the Terms of Service. Users will be informed of material changes at
          least 7 days before their effective date via email or by updating the document header.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes to the Terms take effect after the period indicated in the notice (vacatio legis),
          unless a different legally compliant date is specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continued use of the Service after the changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the
          new terms. If the User does not agree with the changes, they may discontinue use of the
          Service in accordance with section 4.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>19. Termination of Service Provision and Data Retention</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>

          In the event of permanent discontinuation, the Operator will inform Users of the date the
          Service will cease and the procedure concerning User data (export, deletion) in accordance
          with the Privacy Policy and applicable regulations.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>20. Final Provisions, Governing Law, and Jurisdiction</h2>
      <ol>

          the competent court will be the common court of the consumer’s residence or another court
          competent under applicable regulations. If the User is not a consumer, the competent court
          shall be the court with jurisdiction over the Operator’s registered address.
