  <h3>How to play?</h3>
  <p>A question and a person are drawn. Everyone writes an answer.</p>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The question is about someone else → write
      <strong class="highlight">exactly the same</strong>
      as them.
    </li>
    <li>
      The question is about you → write so that
      <strong class="highlight">at least one person</strong>
      guesses correctly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Individual points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Anyone who wrote exactly the same as the chosen person →
      <strong class="highlight">+1 pt</strong>
      .
    </li>
    <li>
      The chosen person gets
      <strong class="highlight">+1 pt</strong>
      if at least one person guessed correctly (otherwise 0).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Team variant</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The chosen person's team: everyone on the team must write exactly the same → then each team
      member gets
      <strong class="highlight">+1 pt</strong>
      .
      <br />
      If even one team member writes differently → the whole team gets
      <strong>0 pts</strong>
      (even those who guessed correctly).
    </li>
    <li>
      People outside the chosen person's team → get points normally (individually) for writing the
      correct answer.
    </li>
  </ul>
