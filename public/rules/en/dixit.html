  <h3>How to play?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>The game draws a player who is the subject of the question.</li>
    <li>Everyone writes their answer.</li>
    <li>
      <strong class="highlight">The chosen player</strong>
      picks one answer they like the most.
      <strong class="highlight">The other players</strong>
      choose which answer they think belongs to the chosen player.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Scoring</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The chosen player</strong>
      gets
      <strong class="highlight">10 pts</strong>
      for everyone who voted for their answer (but
      <strong class="highlight">0 pts</strong>
      if everyone guessed it).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Everyone</strong>
      who voted for the chosen player's answer receives
      <strong class="highlight">10 pts.</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The player</strong>
      whose answer was picked by the chosen player receives an additional
      <strong class="highlight">10 pts</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>When you are the chosen player</strong>
      you want many people to guess your answer…
      <strong class="highlight">but not everyone.</strong>
      Your goal is to answer in a way that is not obvious to everyone.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>When you are not the chosen player</strong>
      you want as many people as possible to choose your answer. That way the chosen player receives
      fewer points.
    </li>
    <p class="final-rule">
      When you are not the chosen player, you only receive points for guessing the chosen player's
      answer!
    </p>
    <i>+ Bonus if the chosen player picks your answer</i>
  </ul>
