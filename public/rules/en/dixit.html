  <h3>How to play?</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>A random person and a question about them are drawn.</li>
    <li>Everyone (including the chosen person) writes an answer.</li>
    <li>Players (except the chosen person) vote on which answer belongs to them.</li>
    <li>The chosen person picks one answer (from the others) that they like the most.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Goals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>If you are being asked about</strong>
      → you want many people to guess your answer…
      <strong class="highlight">but NOT EVERYONE</strong>
      (because then you get 0 pts). Goal: something original, but not too much.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>If you are not being asked about</strong>
      → you want:
      <ul>
        <li>the chosen person to pick your answer</li>
        <li>
          as many people as possible to mistakenly vote for your answer instead of the real one
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Points</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The chosen person gets
      <strong class="highlight">1 pt</strong>
      for each person who voted for their real answer (but
      <strong class="highlight">0 pts</strong>
      if EVERYONE guessed correctly).
    </li>
    <li>
      Each person who voted for the real answer →
      <strong class="highlight">+1 pt</strong>
      .
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>+1 pt</strong>
      – if the chosen person picked your answer ("I like this one").
    </li>
  </ul>
